Motivation:
    I visit bbs.hupu.com every day, but never log in and never post anything. However, suddenly and unexpectedly, the forum has hidden from guests a hyperlink on the first page of each thread, which links to another page displaying only the author's posts in the thread.
    That's not cool. Though I actually have an account for the forum, I just don't feel it worthy of signing in to avoid some more -- though sometimes many more -- clicks on page down and page up.

Inpiration:
    This Sunday I have accidentally seen an unusual url working as above, and I have found out how to modify an original url of a thread to direct me there. Some cuts and pastes? Why not have them done automatically? Just a tiny extension and a new button on Web browser, and some JS practice.

Feature:
    Redirect current tab to a new page showing only the author's posts, just click the icon when at any page number.

Future Extension:
    Modify DOM and show something cool.
    Adapt to other forums.

Thoughts:
    Stack Overflow saves programmers.
    JavaScript and Chrome extension development is of fun.

Easter eggs:
    Description
    Mouse-over-icon title
    Options page
    Once More...
    Go? Gou? GO?
    S-A-O!
